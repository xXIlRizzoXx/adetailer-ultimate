# Changelog

## Unreleased — 2026-05-27 (Localisation: 10 UI languages)

Ten `localizations/*.json` files added covering every fork-added widget — labels, accordion titles, info hints, placeholders, button captions, tooltips and Settings-page options. Languages: `it_IT`, `es_ES`, `fr_FR`, `de_DE`, `zh_CN`, `ja_JP`, `pt_BR`, `ru_RU`, `ko_KR`, `pl_PL`. All ten files share the same 133-key vocabulary, byte-identical keys, identical key order — straightforward to diff.

Mechanism: Forge auto-merges any extension's `localizations/*.json` into `window.localization` at boot. Picking a language via the WebUI's localization setting (or via the [Language Diffusion](https://github.com/xXIlRizzoXx/sd-webui-language-diffusion) extension's top-bar selector) translates the ADetailer panel in place — no restart, no Python changes.

**Policy**: SD/AI technical vocabulary stays in English in every locale (ADetailer, LoRA, CFG, VAE, ControlNet, hires.fix, img2img, inpaint, bbox, YOLO, MediaPipe, CLIP, SDXL, sampler, scheduler, checkpoint, etc.). Rationale: civitai pages, tutorials, and forum threads keep these terms in English universally, so translating them creates friction.

**Quality status**: machine-assisted seeds, native-speaker review welcome. Open an Issue or PR with locale corrections.

## v26.3.0+plus.2 — 2026-05-27 (Hotfix: Forge Neo `cmd_opts.use_cpu` AttributeError on script init)

User-reported from a fresh Forge Neo startup log. The Script class failed
to initialize with `AttributeError: 'Namespace' object has no attribute
'use_cpu'` at `scripts/!adetailer.py:421`, raised inside
`get_ultralytics_device()`. Result: ADetailer's *runtime* hooks never
register — the boot banner still prints "ADetailer initialized" because
the model index loads earlier, but the Script class is missing from
`scripts_data`, so the UI accordion + img2img/txt2img hooks never appear.

**Root cause**: Forge Neo's slimmer `modules.shared.cmd_opts` Namespace
no longer exposes `use_cpu` (same trajectory that removed
`disable_safe_unpickle`, fixed in upstream PR #846). The direct
attribute access at line 421 raised on every startup.

**Fix**: Single-call change — wrap the access in `getattr(shared.cmd_opts,
"use_cpu", None) or []` so the membership check just no-ops on Forge Neo
while continuing to work on stock A1111 / Forge classic. Mirrors the
`disable_safe_unpickle` fix pattern (PR #846 merged upstream).

**Internal**: Verified `cmd_opts.*` access across the whole codebase
(`scripts/!adetailer.py`, `aaaaaa/`, etc.) — every other use already
goes through `getattr(..., default)`. `use_cpu` was the last direct
access remaining.

**Upstream contribution**: not pursued. User decision 2026-05-27 — fork-only.
After PR #847's silent close, the policy is "no further proactive upstream
PRs unless Bing-su re-engages". This fix benefits all Forge Neo users but
stays as a fork differentiator.

## v26.3.0+plus.1 — 2026-05-19 (Settings-page refresh + multi-feature reliability pass)

Sigillo della sessione di test 2026-05-18..2026-05-19. Tutti i 28 test funzionali confermati hands-on dal repo owner, 4 bug-fix non triviali landed mid-test.

**New feature**
- `🔄 Reset ADetailer settings to defaults` button at the bottom of `Settings → ADetailer`. JS confirm()-gated, walks the WebUI options registry, restores every ADetailer-section entry, saves config, reloads the page. Per-tab user_state.json untouched.

**Fixes**
- Apply-only-on-hires.fix gate was always skipping ADetailer in Forge Neo (`is_hr_pass` is reset before `postprocess_image` fires; replaced with a simpler `enable_hr` check).
- LoRA trigger extraction dedup was matching parens INSIDE the LoRA tag itself, causing the extracted trigger phrase to be silently skipped. Strip LoRA tags from the dedup haystack.
- Bbox-as-mask saved preview (`*-ad-preview*.png`) now reflects the toggle state — previously always rendered the seg silhouette regardless of the toggle. The actual inpaint mask was correct, only the saved preview was misleading.
- Settings-API gotcha documented: `OptionDiv` / `OptionHTML` don't set `.section` in their ctor; must be assigned manually or `opts.reorder()` crashes WebUI startup.

**Docs / process**
- README's "NEW IN THIS FORK" section reorganized by UI location (per-tab both modes, per-tab txt2img-only, per-tab img2img-only, Settings, Forge Neo compat, UI polish).
- All 26 fork-added features flipped to 🟢 status after hands-on verification.
- 4 internal "gotcha" memory entries documenting non-obvious Forge Neo behaviours (postprocess_image once vs twice, is_hr_pass timing, OptionDiv section requirement, LoRA-preferred-name interaction with trigger extraction).

**Internal**
- `_should_skip_for_hires_only` simplified to a 4-line decision tree.
- `_append_lora_triggers` dedup haystack now excludes LoRA/LyCORIS tags.
- `ultralytics_predict` clears `pred[0].masks` before `plot()` when bbox-mask substitution is active.

Pending roadmap items (🔴, no code in main): ControlNet crop-aware toggle, WDv3 autotagging, Upstream PRs to Bing-su.

## 2026-05-19 (fix: LoRA trigger extraction dedup ignored parens inside the LoRA tag itself)

User-reported during Test 20. With `Use LoRAs from main prompt` ON and
`Append LoRA triggers from name` ON, the trigger phrase parsed from the
parenthesised section of a LoRA filename was never appended to the
inpaint prompt. Terminal log showed the merged LoRA tag but no extracted
trigger words after it.

Root cause: `_append_lora_triggers` computed its dedup haystack from the
WHOLE prompt — but by the time it ran, `_merge_lora_tags` had already
appended `<lora:name (trigger phrase):weight>` to the prompt. The
dedup check then found the trigger phrase inside the LoRA tag itself and
flagged it as "already present", causing the actual append to be
skipped. The feature looked broken from the outside.

Fix: strip `<lora:...>` and `<lyco:...>` tags from the dedup haystack
before the membership check. The LoRA tags themselves stay in the
returned prompt (only the comparison string is changed). One-line
substitution using the existing `_LORA_TAG_RE`.

File: `scripts/!adetailer.py::_append_lora_triggers`.

## 2026-05-19 (fix: apply-only-on-hires.fix toggle was always skipping ADetailer in Forge Neo)

User-reported during Test 21A. With the toggle ON and hires.fix ON,
ADetailer didn't run at all — terminal log showed only the two sampling
passes (24 base + 24 hires) and zero detection/inpaint activity.

Root cause: the helper `_should_skip_for_hires_only` checked
`p.is_hr_pass` to decide whether the current `postprocess_image` call
was the legitimate post-hires one. But in Forge Neo, `is_hr_pass` is
reset to False in `modules/processing.py:1565` BEFORE the postprocess
callback fires. Critically, Forge Neo only calls `postprocess_image`
ONCE per generation (after hires is fully done), so there's no separate
"pre-hires postprocess" call to opt out of — the original A1111
double-call semantics don't apply.

Fix: drop the `is_hr_pass` check. New logic:
- toggle off → run normally
- img2img → run normally (no hires concept)
- toggle on + hires.fix enabled → RUN ADetailer (it's the only call,
  and the image is already hires-upscaled)
- toggle on + hires.fix disabled → SKIP (the user explicitly asked for
  hires-only ADetailer)

The toggle's effective meaning in Forge Neo is therefore "gate ADetailer
on whether hires.fix is enabled" rather than "pick which postprocess
pass to run". Useful when iterating fast on a base seed and only wanting
ADetailer to engage on hires outputs. README updated to reflect this.

File: `scripts/!adetailer.py::_should_skip_for_hires_only`.

## 2026-05-19 (fix: mask preview now matches the bbox-as-mask toggle state)

When the per-tab `Use bbox as mask (segmentation models)` toggle was on,
the inpaint pass correctly received a rectangular bbox mask but the saved
`*-ad-preview*.png` still showed Ultralytics' seg-silhouette overlay
(generated by `pred[0].plot()` which doesn't know about our substitution).
The runtime feature worked, the preview was misleading.

Fix: in `adetailer/ultralytics.py::ultralytics_predict`, after deciding to
use bbox masks we set `pred[0].masks = None` BEFORE calling `plot()`. The
Ultralytics plotter then skips the seg overlay and renders only the bbox
+ class label — which accurately represents what the inpaint pass uses.
Wrapped in `try/except (AttributeError, TypeError)` to stay safe on older
Ultralytics versions / the `_SubsetWrapper` fallback path.

Reproduced by user 2026-05-19 during Test 22: A/B comparison with toggle
OFF vs ON showed identical mask previews but different final images
(because the runtime mask DID change, only the saved preview didn't
reflect it). Post-fix the saved preview matches the actual inpaint mask.

Files: `adetailer/ultralytics.py` (one conditional block added).

## 2026-05-19 (feat: reset-to-defaults button on the Settings → ADetailer page)

User request: "aggiungiamo un tasto nelle impostazioni che permetta di
resettare i settaggi vari dell'estensione stessa". Added a red button at
the bottom of `Settings → ADetailer` that restores every option on that
page to its declared default and reloads the page so widgets re-read the
fresh values.

Implementation:

- `scripts/!adetailer.py` — two new helpers above `on_ui_settings()`:
  - `_reset_adetailer_settings()` walks `shared.opts.data_labels`,
    filters to entries whose `section[0] == "ADetailer"`, skips
    `do_not_save=True` rows (HTML/divider/the button itself), calls
    `shared.opts.set(key, info.default, run_callbacks=False)` for each
    remaining entry, then `shared.opts.save(shared.config_filename)`.
  - `_make_reset_settings_button(**kwargs)` is the component factory
    passed as the option's `component=`. Drops the `label` kwarg that
    Forge Neo's setting framework feeds every component (gr.Button
    doesn't take `label`), uses the OptionInfo `default` as the visible
    button text, sets `variant="stop"` for the red colour, attaches a
    `.click` handler whose Python side runs the reset and whose JS side
    fires a `confirm()` dialog and triggers `location.reload()` ~800ms
    after the click.
- New `OptionInfo` registered at the end of `on_ui_settings()` with
  `do_not_save=True` so the framework doesn't try to persist the
  button's "value" string. Preceded by an `OptionDiv()` divider
  (imported from `modules.options`; not re-exported via `shared.py`) and
  a `shared.OptionHTML()` block explaining what the button does.
- `style.css` — new rule `button.ad-settings-reset-btn,
  button[id="setting_ad_reset_button"]` caps `max-width: 360px`, adds
  the rounded-corners + nowrap treatment shared with the other fork
  buttons, and a small top margin to separate from the helper text
  above.
- `preview.py` — added a mock of the divider + helper text + red button
  in the Settings → ADetailer stub tab so the preview shows the visual
  shape of the new control. (The mock is purely visual; the real reset
  logic only runs inside Forge Neo.)

Per-tab widget state stashed in `user_state.json` is intentionally not
touched by this button — only Settings-page options are reset. If the
user wants to clear cached tab state as well, the documented path is to
toggle `Remember last-used settings` off, save once, toggle it back on.

Files:
- scripts/!adetailer.py (helpers + registration + import of OptionDiv)
- style.css (button styling rule)
- preview.py (Settings stub mock)
- README.md (NEW IN THIS FORK row + dedicated `## Reset Settings` section)

Status: 🟡 ships under v26.2.0+plus.2; Test 27 added to the pending
list, awaiting hands-on verification in Forge Neo.

## 2026-05-18 (ui: breathing room between widgets in the ControlNet section)

User-reported: the ControlNet row at the bottom of each ADetailer tab
packed its widgets so tightly that the stacked dropdowns and sliders
were visually stuck to each other — no breathing room. Cause: `gr.Column
(variant="compact")` collapses inter-widget margins.

aaaaaa/ui.py: the outer `gr.Row(variant="panel")` of the `controlnet()`
section now also carries `elem_classes=["ad-cn-row"]`. Comment block
documents the user-feedback rationale.

style.css: new rule
    .ad-cn-row > div > div + div { margin-top: 10px !important; }
adds a 10px gap between stacked siblings inside each column of the
ControlNet row. First widget keeps its natural top spacing; subsequent
ones gain the gap.

Verified live via Claude Preview: ControlNet weight + guidance-end
sliders both report `margin-top: 10px` from getComputedStyle.

## 2026-05-18 (ux + ui: shorter Paste label, readable preset-status, auto-fade)

Three small fixes from a single round of user feedback during Test 7
/ Test 11 / Test 25 hands-on verification:

1. **Paste button label was overflowing.** After clicking Copy on
   tab N, the Paste button on every other tab updates its label to
   include the source-tab number. The previous format `📥 Paste
   settings from Nth tab here` was 36 chars and overflowed the 160px
   min_width, making the 📥 emoji render oddly in Chromium.
   Shortened to `📥 Paste from Nth tab` (21 chars) — fits cleanly
   and keeps the emoji legible.
2. **preset_status was too faded to read at a glance.** Bumped
   opacity from 0.75 → 0.95 and font-size from 11 → 12px in
   `.ad-preset-status`. Still subtle enough to not shout for
   attention, but legible.
3. **Status messages now auto-fade after 4 seconds.** New file
   `javascript/preset-status-fade.js` watches every `.ad-preset-
   status` container, detects when its inner markdown gains non-
   empty content, and clears that content 4 s later. The
   `:has(.md:empty)` CSS rule then hides the container so it
   doesn't leave a styled-but-empty band. Only touches the DOM;
   doesn't notify Gradio's reactive store. Next user action that
   writes a message restarts the cycle.

Files:
- aaaaaa/ui.py: `_copy_fn` label string shortened.
- style.css: `.ad-preset-status` font + opacity bump, comment block
  notes the auto-fade pairing.
- javascript/preset-status-fade.js: new file.

## 2026-05-18 (ui: bump left padding on amber pill so text doesn't hug the border)

User-reported follow-up on the amber preview-status pill: the text was
sitting too close to the orange border-left, which made the pill feel
visually unbalanced. Bumped the pill's left padding from 12px to 18px
(symmetric became asymmetric: `6px 12px 6px 18px`) — text now has ~6px
of extra breathing room from the amber border bar.

style.css: `div.block.ad-preview-status` padding shorthand updated.
Comment block notes the user-feedback rationale.

## 2026-05-18 (ui: gap + vertical-center on Detection-preview status pill)

User-reported two micro-issues on the amber-pill warning that sits
next to the "Run detection preview" button:

1. The pill was touching the button (no breathing room).
2. The text inside the pill was vertically off-center compared to the
   button's label.

style.css fixes on `div.block.ad-preview-status`:
- `margin: 0 0 0 10px` — adds a 10px gap from the button on its left,
  zeroes out the top margin so the pill aligns with the button's flex
  row baseline.
- `padding: 6px 12px` (was `4px 10px`) — slightly more breathing room
  inside the pill.
- `display: flex; align-items: center` — vertically centers the inner
  markdown wrapper / `<p>` within the pill height. Now the text sits
  on the same horizontal centerline as the button's label.
- Added `line-height: 1.4` on the `<p>` for cleaner text rhythm.

## 2026-05-18 (ui + ux: native hover tooltips on buttons + taller class-prompts box)

Two user-feedback follow-ups:

**V66 — `ad_class_prompts` textbox felt cramped.** The multi-line
placeholder example (4 lines: syntax intro + "Example:" label + 2
sample entries) was bumping against the bottom of the box. Bumped
`lines=4` → `lines=5` so the placeholder fits without scrolling.

**V68 — buttons had no hover tooltips.** `gr.Button` doesn't expose an
`info=` parameter the way `gr.Checkbox` / `gr.Dropdown` / `gr.Slider`
do, so there was no built-in mechanism. Added a small standalone
JavaScript file that walks the fork's action buttons and sets the
native HTML `title` attribute — the browser then renders the standard
tooltip after ~1 s of hover. Buttons covered:

- Copy / Paste settings (top-of-tab clipboard)
- Load / Rename / Delete / Save preset / Reset preset (preset library)
- Export to JSON / Import (preset library export-import accordion)
- Run detection preview (Detection preview accordion)

Files:
- `aaaaaa/ui.py`: `w.ad_class_prompts = gr.Textbox(..., lines=5, ...)`
  (was 4). Comment block notes the user-feedback rationale.
- `javascript/button-tooltips.js`: new file. ~70 LOC pure JS, no
  dependencies. Maps each elem_id fragment to a tooltip string and
  applies it via `el.title = "..."`. Re-runs via `MutationObserver`
  so tooltips survive Gradio's reactive rerenders (preset load,
  tab switches). Idempotent (guarded by `!target.title`).
- `preview.py`: extended to read and inject every `javascript/*.js`
  file via `gr.Blocks(head="<script>...</script>")`, the same way
  Forge Neo auto-loads them at the extension root. Without this,
  the Claude Preview tab wouldn't show the tooltips.

Verified live via Claude Preview: tooltip text appears on hover for
all 7 fork buttons (4 immediately, 3 after opening their parent
accordions — the MutationObserver picks them up automatically).

## 2026-05-18 (fix: amber-pill not nested anymore — single chip)

User-reported follow-up on the previous amber-pill commit: the warning
rendered as TWO nested amber chips (one inside the other) because
Gradio propagates `elem_classes=["ad-preview-status"]` to BOTH the
outer `.block` wrapper AND the inner `.prose` markdown wrapper. The
`.ad-preview-status { background; border-left; padding; rounded }` rule
was matching both, drawing two boxes.

Fix: scope the pill styling to only the outer wrapper via
`div.block.ad-preview-status` (more specific selector that doesn't
match the inner `.prose` markdown div). Text properties (color, font
size, opacity) stay on `.ad-preview-status p` so they apply regardless
of which wrapper the `<p>` is nested under.

style.css
- `.ad-preview-status, .ad-preview-status p { ... }` → split into:
    `div.block.ad-preview-status { background; border-left; padding; rounded }`
    `.ad-preview-status p          { color; font-size; opacity; reset margins }`
- Comment block expanded to warn future edits about the dual-class
  Gradio propagation.

Verified live via Claude Preview: outer wrapper has the amber pill
styling (bg + border + padding), inner wrapper has transparent
background + 0 padding. Single chip on screen, no nesting.

## 2026-05-18 (ux: legible amber-pill warning for Detection preview status)

User-reported: the "⚠️ Pick a detector model first." warning emitted by
the Detection preview button was rendering as faded 11px grey text
because the status markdown widget shared the `.ad-preset-status`
class (which is intentionally dim, designed for non-shouting status
lines like "preset saved"). Warnings need to be readable at a glance.

- aaaaaa/ui.py: `w.ad_preview_status` now uses `elem_classes=["ad-preview-status"]`
  (dedicated class) instead of sharing `.ad-preset-status`. Comment
  block notes the rationale.
- style.css: new `.ad-preview-status` ruleset — full opacity, 12px font,
  amber color (#fbbf24), subtle amber pill background, amber-tinted
  border-left. Auto-hide-when-empty rule extended to include the new
  class so the pill only appears when there's a message to show.

Verified live via Claude Preview by injecting the warning text into
the markdown widget: the pill renders as a clearly-visible amber
"chip" inline with the Run-detection-preview button.

## 2026-05-18 (ux: info text on CLASSES dropdown explains "empty = all")

User-reported confusion: when a multiclass detector is selected, the
CLASSES dropdown is intentionally NOT auto-populated (it's a filter —
empty means "no narrowing, all classes detected"). But the empty state
looks identical to "broken, nothing will be detected".

Added a `gr.Dropdown(..., info="If empty, ALL classes the model
produces are inpainted. Select to narrow down to specific classes.")`
to the `ad_model_classes_dropdown` widget so the empty default is
self-explanatory.

- aaaaaa/ui.py: `gr.Dropdown(info=...)` parameter added to
  `w.ad_model_classes_dropdown`. Comment block notes the UX rationale.

## 2026-05-18 (ui: margin between preset-name-to-save row and Copy/Paste row)

User reported the Copy/Paste settings buttons were touching the
"Preset name to save" textbox directly above them in Forge Neo — no
breathing room. Added a `.ad-tab-clipboard-row` class on the Copy/Paste
row and a `margin-top: 10px` rule in `style.css` mirroring the
existing `.ad-preset-save-row` spacing. The two rows now sit with a
visible 10px gap.

- aaaaaa/ui.py: gr.Row for Copy/Paste now has elem_classes=["ad-tab-clipboard-row"].
- style.css: new rule for `.ad-tab-clipboard-row` { margin-top: 10px !important }.

## 2026-05-18 (ui: shorter label on the export button — "📤 Esport")

User-requested label tweak after the nowrap fix landed: the export
DownloadButton now reads `📤 Esport` (was `📤 Export to JSON`).
Shorter label = tighter button, more consistent visual weight with the
adjacent `📥 Import` UploadButton. Emoji kept on both buttons for
parallel visual markers.

## 2026-05-18 (ui: nowrap on Export/Import buttons + preview.py brand rename)

Visual-inspection sweep via Claude Preview turned up a regression on the new
Export/Import buttons added 2026-05-16: the "Export to JSON" label wrapped
onto two lines (taller than its single-line siblings) because the CSS
nowrap rule had not been extended to cover the new button elem_ids.

- `style.css`: `ad_preset_export_btn` and `ad_preset_import_btn` added to
  the `button[id*="..."]` nowrap selector list. `gr.DownloadButton` /
  `gr.UploadButton` render as `<button>` at the root so the same rule
  applies — confirmed via preview restart.
- `preview.py` + `.claude/launch.json`: title strings updated from
  "ADetailer Plus" → "ADetailer Ultimate" so the Claude Preview header
  is consistent with the current brand. Launch-config name renamed
  `adetailer-plus-preview` → `adetailer-ultimate-preview`.

Same-pass also confirmed via Preview the following are working as
expected: brand-prefixed live overlay with current git short-hash
(7fe99b9), Copy/Paste row below preset-name-to-save row, compact
Export/Import accordion (~70px expanded), empty preset_status /
preset_io_status hidden via `:has(.md:empty)` (no dead bands).

## 2026-05-16 (ui: hide empty preview/status markdown containers)

User reported a visual artifact: an empty styled band between the preset row and the detector section, even with no preset selected. The cause: `gr.Markdown` widgets with empty content still render their outer `div.block` container, and our CSS adds padding / border-left / background to `.ad-preset-preview`, making the empty shell visible as a useless box. Two-pronged fix:

- **Python side** (`aaaaaa/ui.py`): `_format_preset_preview` now returns `gr.update(value=..., visible=bool)` instead of a raw string, so the preview component is hidden entirely when no preset is selected (or `(none)` sentinel chosen). Initial `preset_preview = gr.Markdown(..., visible=False)`.
- **CSS fallback** (`style.css`): new rule using the `:has(.md:empty)` selector to collapse any `.ad-preset-preview` or `.ad-preset-status` container whose inner markdown span is empty. Covers `preset_status` and `preset_io_status` (whose handlers live in `_wire_presets` and weren't refactored), and acts as a safety net for the preview if Gradio ever fails to apply the visibility update.

End result: the preset block now has zero vertical footprint between rows when no message / preview is showing. The styled border + background only appear when there's actual content.

## 2026-05-16 (ui: tab-state controls reordered + Export/Import compacted)

Two layout-level changes to the tab-state block at the top of each ADetailer tab. The widgets and behaviour are unchanged; only the order and the rendering of Export/Import are different.

**Reorder (top-to-bottom of the tab now)**:
1. `Enable this tab` — alone on its row (was sharing the row with Copy/Paste).
2. `▾ Preset library export / import` accordion — **moved from the bottom of the preset block to immediately under Enable**. Collapsed by default, so the daily-use preset row stays the first thing the eye lands on after Enable.
3. **Preset library** — `Saved presets ▾ + Load + Rename + Delete` row, then `Preset name + Save preset + Reset` row (unchanged).
4. `[📋 Copy settings]  [📥 Paste settings]` — **moved DOWN from the very top of the tab to directly under the preset-name-to-save row**. All "tab-state copying operations" (Save preset, Reset, Copy, Paste) are now grouped in one visual block.
5. Preset status + live preview markdown (unchanged).

**Compaction of the Export/Import accordion**:
- The two big `gr.File` drop-zones (each rendering ~100px tall whether or not they have content) are replaced by `gr.DownloadButton` for export and `gr.UploadButton` for import — both render as ordinary buttons, much shorter vertically.
- Three controls now fit on a single row: `[📤 Export to JSON]  [📥 Import]  ☐ Overwrite on conflict`.
- The accordion's expanded height drops from ~280px to ~70px.
- Wiring change: `preset_export_btn.click(...).then(...)` — the click handler returns a file path that Gradio uses to trigger the download AND updates `preset_export_btn` itself (modern DownloadButton pattern), followed by a `.then(...)` that writes the status line. `preset_import_btn.upload(...)` fires on file pick/drop and the button's value carries the uploaded path.

## 2026-05-16 (ui: overlay auto-updates with current git short-hash)

The top-right overlay used to be a static `"ADetailer Ultimate · v26.2.0+plus.2"` string — informative but unable to signal "is my install current?" because the locked `__version__` never changes between commits. Now the overlay also appends the current commit's 7-char short hash, read directly from `<extension_root>/.git/HEAD` at UI-build time:

```
ADetailer Ultimate · v26.2.0+plus.2 · 63a9dd2
```

- `aaaaaa/ui.py`: two new helpers `_read_git_short_hash()` (reads HEAD + the referenced ref file, with packed-refs fallback) and `_build_overlay_text()` (composes the final string). The `gr.Markdown` for the overlay now calls `_build_overlay_text()` instead of a hardcoded f-string.
- `style.css`: `.ad-version-overlay` `max-width` raised from 280px → 360px to fit the longer string (~47 chars at 11px).
- No `subprocess` call — pure file reads, works without `git` on PATH, degrades to brand-only when `.git` is missing (e.g. zip installs).
- The hash auto-updates every time `adui()` rebuilds the panel (Forge Neo restart, full UI reload). User can verify their install is at the latest commit by comparing the overlay hash to the one reported at the end of each push report.

## 2026-05-16 (ui: version overlay now brand-prefixed)

- The version badge in the top-right of the accordion header used to read just `v26.2.0+plus.2`. After the rename to **ADetailer Ultimate** + the addition of ~37 fork features, that string alone was ambiguous (the `+plus.2` build-metadata refers to a previous fork name kept locked per the no-auto-bump rule). The overlay now reads `ADetailer Ultimate · v26.2.0+plus.2` so the brand is visible at a glance without altering the locked version string.
- `aaaaaa/ui.py`: `gr.Markdown(f"ADetailer Ultimate · v{__version__}", ...)`.
- `style.css`: `.ad-version-overlay` `max-width` bumped from 220px to 280px to fit the longer string without horizontal clipping.

## 2026-05-16 (feat: 5-feature batch — peer-fork roadmap items 3, 4, 5, 8, 9)

Implements five of the remaining roadmap items in one batch. All five are 🟡 (in the codebase, awaiting hands-on verification by the repo owner — Tests 22 through 26 added to the pending sticky list).

### Detection / mask

- **Bounding-box mask for segmentation models** (`ad_use_bbox_mask`, default off) — new per-tab checkbox in the **Mask preprocessing** accordion. Forces the rectangular bounding box as the inpaint mask even when the YOLO model produced a precise per-pixel segmentation mask. Useful when the seg mask is too tight against the subject and the inpaint needs more breathing room. Implemented as a single conditional in `adetailer.ultralytics.ultralytics_predict` + a new `use_bbox_mask` kwarg in its signature. Inspired by [newtextdoc1111/adetailer](https://github.com/newtextdoc1111/adetailer).

### Inpainting / resolution

- **Scale-based inpaint resolution** (`ad_use_resolution_scale` + `ad_resolution_scale`, default off / 1.5×) — new checkbox + slider in the **Inpainting** section. When the toggle is on, the inpaint canvas is `bbox_size × scale` (rounded down to a multiple of 8 for SD UNet compatibility, 64-pixel floor). Mutually exclusive with the existing `Use separate width/height` toggle — when both are on, the fixed-dimensions toggle wins. Math centralised in `fix_p2`. Inspired by [Anzhc/aadetailer-reforge](https://github.com/Anzhc/aadetailer-reforge).

### Sequential class detection / prompts

- **Class-specific prompts** (`ad_class_prompts`, default empty) — new multiline textbox in the **Inpaint prompts** accordion. Syntax (one per line): `classname: positive_prompt [| negative_prompt]`. When the sequential class detection feature is on, each class's pass reads its dedicated prompt from this textbox; entries with empty values fall back to the tab's default `ad_prompt`/`ad_negative_prompt`. Lines that don't match the syntax are silently ignored. Parser `_parse_class_prompts` in `scripts/!adetailer.py`. Inspired by [newtextdoc1111/adetailer](https://github.com/newtextdoc1111/adetailer).

### Preset library polish

- **Live preset preview with `[SEP]`/`[PROMPT]` awareness** — new markdown block under the preset dropdown that updates on every `preset_dropdown.change` event. Shows the highlighted preset's detector, classes (include/exclude), sequential flag, prompts (truncated), and class-specific prompts summary. `[SEP]` and `[PROMPT]` tokens are wrapped in backticks with a footnote reminding the user they'll be expanded at generation time. Formatter `_format_preset_preview` in `aaaaaa/ui.py`. CSS scoped via `.ad-preset-preview` in `style.css`.
- **Export / Import preset library to JSON** — new "Preset library export / import" accordion (collapsed by default) under the preset row. **Export**: button generates a `gr.File` download of the entire `user_presets.json` (sorted, indented). **Import**: drop a JSON file in the upload box, optionally tick "Overwrite existing on conflict", click Import. Status line summarises added / replaced / skipped counts. Cross-tab dropdown refresh after import is local-to-current-tab (other tabs pick up new presets on next UI reload). Library helpers `export_presets_json` and `import_presets_json` in `adetailer/presets.py`.

### Pydantic schema additions

- `ad_use_bbox_mask: bool = False`
- `ad_use_resolution_scale: bool = False`
- `ad_resolution_scale: confloat(ge=0.5, le=8.0) = 1.5`
- `ad_class_prompts: str = ""`

All four ship with infotext mapping entries so they round-trip through PNG-info save/load.

## 2026-05-16 (audit + fixes: txt2img/img2img parity)

Code-review audit of every fork feature against both `StableDiffusionProcessingTxt2Img` and `StableDiffusionProcessingImg2Img` pipelines. Two issues found and fixed; everything else was already mode-agnostic.

- **Fix A — "Apply only on hires.fix" wrongly skipped img2img.** The toggle, when on, was treating img2img runs as "hires.fix is off → skip the tab entirely". Img2img has no hires.fix concept, so this manifested as the tab silently doing nothing when a user enabled the toggle in txt2img and later opened img2img. Fix on two layers:
  - `_should_skip_for_hires_only` now early-returns `False` when `isinstance(p, StableDiffusionProcessingImg2Img)`. The toggle becomes a no-op in img2img.
  - UI checkbox is now `visible=not is_img2img` (symmetric with the existing `ad_skip_img2img` widget which is `visible=is_img2img`). The widget still exists in the component list — its value from persistence/preset is honoured by the runtime check above as defense-in-depth.
- **Fix B — persistence shared state between txt2img and img2img.** `user_state.json` was keyed by tab index only (`"0"`, `"1"`, …), so a Generate click in img2img Tab 1 overwrote whatever txt2img Tab 1 had stashed. Now keys are scoped as `"<mode>:<tab_index>"` (e.g. `"txt2img:0"`, `"img2img:2"`). Legacy unscoped keys still load for both modes for backwards compatibility on upgrade — the next Generate writes the scoped form and the legacy entry stays dormant until the file is overwritten.
- Files touched: `scripts/!adetailer.py` (helper), `aaaaaa/ui.py` (checkbox visibility + `mode` param wiring), `adetailer/persistence.py` (new scoping logic + back-compat legacy reads).

Other audited features confirmed mode-agnostic: class filtering (include + NOT + sequential + activation order), detection preview, JSON sidecar tolerance, prompt append fields, LoRA inclusion + trigger extraction, Copy/Paste between tabs, named preset library, manual mode, save intermediate steps, all UI polish.

## 2026-05-16 (feat: "Apply only on hires.fix" toggle)

- **"Apply only on hires.fix"** — new per-tab checkbox `ad_apply_on_hires_only` (default off) that skips the tab's ADetailer pass during the lowres pre-hires.fix postprocess call and runs it only when the post-upscale image is ready. Saves compute when hires.fix is going to overwrite the lowres detail anyway. Inspired by [Anzhc/aadetailer-reforge](https://github.com/Anzhc/aadetailer-reforge).
- Decision matrix (helper `_should_skip_for_hires_only(p, args)`):
  - Toggle off → never skip.
  - Toggle on, hires.fix enabled, **in hires pass** (`p.is_hr_pass == True`) → run normally.
  - Toggle on, hires.fix enabled, lowres pre-hires call (`is_hr_pass == False`) → skip.
  - Toggle on, hires.fix off, or img2img run → skip entirely (the user explicitly asked for hires-only and no hires step is coming).
- Files:
  - `adetailer/args.py`: new pydantic field + infotext mapping `"ADetailer apply on hires only"`.
  - `scripts/!adetailer.py`: new helper `_should_skip_for_hires_only`, called inside the per-tab loop in `postprocess_image` right after `args.need_skip()`.
  - `aaaaaa/ui.py`: new `gr.Checkbox` on its own row below the LoRA checkboxes.
- Status: implemented, **awaiting hands-on verification** by the repo owner (Test 21 added to the pending list).

## 2026-05-16 (feat: LoRA trigger extraction)

- **LoRA trigger extraction** — new sub-toggle `Append LoRA triggers from name` (`ad_use_lora_triggers`, default off) under the existing `Use LoRAs from main prompt` checkbox. When both checkboxes are on, ADetailer parses the convention `<lora:name (trigger phrase):weight>` (from [Anzhc/aadetailer-reforge](https://github.com/Anzhc/aadetailer-reforge)) and appends the parenthesised trigger phrase to the inpaint prompt. Triggers are deduplicated case-insensitively against the existing prompt body. Backwards-compatible: LoRA tags without parentheses are unaffected, and the negative-prompt pipeline is left untouched (triggers only make sense in the positive).
- Implementation:
  - New regex `_LORA_TRIGGER_RE = re.compile(r"\(([^)]+)\)")` matching the first non-greedy parenthesised substring inside a LoRA tag's name.
  - New helpers `_extract_lora_triggers(tags)` and `_append_lora_triggers(prompt, triggers)` in `scripts/!adetailer.py`.
  - `_get_prompt` gains an `include_triggers: bool = False` keyword. `get_prompt` passes `bool(args.ad_use_main_loras and args.ad_use_lora_triggers)`.
  - New pydantic field `ad_use_lora_triggers: bool = False` and infotext mapping entry `"ADetailer use lora triggers"`.
  - UI: a second checkbox added to the existing LoRA row, with `info=` hint showing the expected convention.
- Status: implemented, **awaiting hands-on verification** by the repo owner (Test 20 added to the pending list).

## 2026-05-16 (rename → ADetailer Ultimate)

- Project renamed to **ADetailer Ultimate**: GitHub repo `xXIlRizzoXx/adetailer-plus` → `xXIlRizzoXx/adetailer-ultimate`. README title and install URL updated. `style.css` header comment updated. The slug was briefly `adetailer_ultimate` (underscore) for a few minutes before being normalised to `adetailer-ultimate` (hyphen) to match the SD WebUI extension-ecosystem convention. All previous URLs continue to work via GitHub's automatic redirect chain (`xXIlRizzoXx/adetailer` → `adetailer-plus` → `adetailer_ultimate` → `adetailer-ultimate`).

## 2026-05-16 (rename → ADetailer Plus + roadmap expansion)

- Project renamed back to **ADetailer Plus**: GitHub repo `xXIlRizzoXx/adetailer` → `xXIlRizzoXx/adetailer-plus`. README title and install URL updated. `style.css` header comment updated. Old `xXIlRizzoXx/adetailer` URLs continue to work via GitHub's automatic redirect.
- README **Roadmap (not yet implemented)** section expanded from 4 to 10 items after analysing the two most-starred forks of upstream `Bing-su/adetailer`:
  - From [Anzhc/aadetailer-reforge](https://github.com/Anzhc/aadetailer-reforge) (22★): LoRA trigger extraction (`<lora:name (trigger):1>` parsing), "Apply only on hires.fix" toggle, scale-based resolution, WDv3 autotagging.
  - From [newtextdoc1111/adetailer](https://github.com/newtextdoc1111/adetailer) (14★): class-specific prompts (per-class prompt in sequential mode), bounding-box mask option for segmentation models.
- The new Roadmap table includes an **Inspiration** column crediting the upstream fork where each idea originated.

## 2026-05-15 → 2026-05-16 (plus: workflow ergonomics — extended)

- v26.2.0+plus.2 (version locked here per repo-owner request; further fork features ship under the same string until an explicit bump)
- Project renaming history (pre-2026-05-16): `adetailer-classfilter` (initial) → `adetailer-plus` (scope expansion) → `adetailer` (briefly simplified) → `adetailer-plus` (current). GitHub redirects keep all old URLs working.

### Detection

- **Sequential class detection** — new "Process classes sequentially" checkbox. When multiple classes are selected in the dropdown, runs one detect+inpaint pass per class in dropdown order, each operating on the output of the previous. Better separation of regions and cleaner per-class inpainting at the cost of longer runtime. Ignored for MediaPipe, NOT mode, and single-class selections. Implemented via top-of-function recursion in `_postprocess_image_inner` with single-class `args.copy(update=...)`.
- **Class pass order = activation order** — the order in which the user clicks classes in the multi-select dropdown is the order they're processed under Sequential class detection. Re-ordering = click × on a token then re-click its name (it goes to the end). Native Gradio behaviour; no JS. An earlier iteration shipped a `javascript/class-reorder.js` HTML5 drag-and-drop handler with a deselect-then-reselect sync; it caused tokens to flicker out of the DOM during the operation, and the simpler native-order approach makes it unnecessary. The JS file is removed.
- **Detection preview** — accordion at the bottom of each tab with a "Run detection preview" button. Runs the configured detector against the most recent generation (or img2img input) and renders bounding boxes / mask without inpainting. Useful for tuning confidence + mask preprocessing without burning a full generation.

### Workflow & prompting

- **`ad_prompt_append` / `ad_negative_prompt_append`** — two new single-line fields under the main prompt textboxes that append to the resolved inpaint prompt without forcing the user to duplicate the main prompt. New pydantic fields with empty-string defaults; stripped from infotext when at defaults.
- **Include LoRAs from main prompt** — when the tab's prompt is blank and the checkbox is on, `<lora:name:weight>` tags are scraped out of the main txt2img/img2img prompt and merged into the inpaint prompt. New pydantic field `ad_use_main_loras: bool`.
- **Copy / Paste between tabs** — clipboard-style flow: one "Copy settings" button per tab snapshots the current tab's processing settings; every other tab's "Paste settings" button enables and re-labels to "Paste settings from Nth tab here", clicking it applies the snapshot. Detector, class filter and per-tab enable are deliberately excluded from the snapshot. The clipboard is sticky — paste into multiple tabs in a row, or overwrite by Copying from a different tab.
- **Named preset library** — Load / Save / Delete / Rename per tab, dropdown shared across tabs. Each preset stores every widget value in the tab. Persisted to `<extension_root>/user_presets.json` with atomic writes; corruption-tolerant. A `(none)` sentinel entry sits at the top of every dropdown for explicit clearing without touching widget state. `Reset preset` clears the dropdown label without modifying widgets. Implemented in `adetailer/presets.py`.
- **Persistent last-used settings** — every Generate click stashes per-tab widget state to `<extension_root>/user_state.json` (atomic write). Restored as initial values at the next WebUI start. Toggle in `Settings → ADetailer → Remember last used settings` (default on). Implemented in `adetailer/persistence.py`.
- **Manual mode** — `Settings → ADetailer → Manual mode` short-circuits `postprocess_image` while preserving widget state, for iterating on prompt/seed/sampler without ADetailer between every run.
- **Save intermediate steps** — `Settings → ADetailer → Save intermediate steps` writes out the after-each-tab images alongside the final result (`_adetailer_step1.png`, `_adetailer_step2.png`, …).

### Forge Neo compatibility

- `aaaaaa/helper.py`: `disable_safe_unpickle` switched to `patch.object(..., create=True)` so Forge Neo's slimmer `modules.shared.cmd_opts` (which doesn't expose the legacy `disable_safe_unpickle` attribute) no longer crashes ADetailer's model loading.
- `adetailer/classes.py`: `_names_from_json` is tolerant of civitai_helper-style metadata JSON sidecars — when the file shape doesn't look like a class-name container, it returns `[]` so the loader falls back to `model.names` instead of raising.

### UI polish

- Section labels (`.ad-section-label`) in bright white, small uppercase, scoped via CSS.
- Action buttons (`Copy`, `Paste`, preset Load/Save/Rename/Delete/Reset, detection preview) get rounded corners (8px) and `white-space: nowrap` so widths don't double the height on label wrap.
- Version badge overlay (`.ad-version-overlay`) pinned to the top-right of the accordion header — auto-hides when the accordion collapses.
- Top of every tab: `Enable this tab` checkbox + `Copy settings` + `Paste settings` row as direct top-level widgets (no nested accordion).

## 2026-05-15 (fork: class-filtering)

- v26.2.0+classfilter.1
- **Fork only** — per-class filtering for multiclass YOLO detection models.
  - New auto-populated multi-select dropdown `ADetailer detector classes` for non-YOLO-World models. Reads class names from `model.names` or a sidecar `<model>.json`.
  - New `Exclude selected (NOT)` checkbox to invert the filter (inpaint everything except the selected classes).
  - Include path uses Ultralytics' native `model(classes=[ids])` keyword — zero post-processing cost.
  - Exclude path filters `pred[0].boxes.cls` after inference.
  - New Pydantic fields `ad_model_classes_exclude: bool` and `ad_model_classes_excluded: str`; defaults preserve byte-identical infotext for workflows that don't use the feature.
  - YOLO-World text-based class entry is preserved unchanged.
  - MediaPipe models keep all class widgets hidden.
- Design inspired by [wkpark/uddetailer](https://github.com/wkpark/uddetailer); implementation by Claude (Anthropic).
